## Wake-on-LAN

When the cluster is setup it is often not needed to have the machines powered when there is no job in the queue.

What you can setup is a simple Wake-on-LAN script that will only wakeup the machines when there is job in the queue waiting.

For examplary purposes we document a script here that works on a low power *Raspberry PI* that we have active in our 
local network, but any simple microcontroller that has HTTP capabilites will.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# filename: wake_machine.sh


# Install this script as a cronjob
# m h  dom mon dow   command
# 15\/* * * * * bash /home/pi/wake_machine.sh

## You need the wakeonlan and the jq package installed
## sudo apt install wakeonlan jq -y


output=$(curl "https://api.green-coding.io/v1/jobs?machine_id=7&state=WAITING" --silent  |  jq '.["data"] | length')

# Check if the output is a specific string
if [[ "$output" =~ ^[0-9]+$ && $output -ne 0 ]]; then
    echo "Having waiting jobs. Sending Wake on LAN magic packet ..."

    # Please replace '80:1B:3E:A8:26:19' with your machines MAC address
    # Using port 1234 will usually work. If you run into issues try port 9, 8 or 7 also
    # Do not use the IP address of the machine, but the broadcast address (usually the last number block must be replaced by 255)
    wakeonlan -i 10.1.0.255 -p 1234 80:1B:3E:A8:26:19

    echo "Wake on LAN magic packet send!"
else
    echo "Command output is '0'. No other program started."
fi
```

### Turning machine off on empty queue
To use this functionality you should have *Wake-on-LAN* activated.

You can then set the `shutdown_on_job_no` to *True* and the machine will turn off when the job queue is empty.

```yml
cluster:
  client:
    ...  
    shutdown_on_job_no: True
```

In order for the shutdown to be triggered by the `client.py` you must allow the `sudo` call without password in an `/etc/sudoers.d/` entry.

Example:
```bash
echo 'ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/systemctl suspend' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/green-coding-shutdown
sudo chmod 500 /etc/sudoers.d/green-coding-shutdown
```
