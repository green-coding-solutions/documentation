## Running GMT out of GitHub codespace

If you do not want to install the Green Metrics Tool but just want to try out a quick running version use our [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/green-metrics-tool/).

Just click on *Code* and then on *Create codespace on main* to start the Codespace. An interactive interface with instructions will guide you through first steps with the Green Metrics Tool.
