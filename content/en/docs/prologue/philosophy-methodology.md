Our system is designed to raise awareness and educate about the software energy use in 
typical off-the-shelf systems.

This reduces its accuary and reproducability compared to a calibrated and purely deterministic system 
like a trimmed down real-time OS, but increases the generality and applicability.

It does however give you the capability to iterate and optimize on your apps energy
consumption on a fixed hardware setup.

The result is that you get an idea of the order of magnitude the energy consumption of your softwre is in, but 
does typically not allow you to make comparisons on exact numbers.

However when running on different hardware a comparison by the order of magnitude is very helpful to judge the underlying hardware.


## Containerization

We believe in the containerization of applications. The benefits are that the overhead is extremely small and it allows us to control the execution, interfacting, and environment around the application. Most modern applications are already containerized or can be easily brought into this format (at least for the purpose of measuring).

Therefore the Green Metrics Tool is designed to primarily measure containerized applications.

## Architecture & Technology

We rely on the container specification that is most dominantly implemented by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

We orchestrate the containers in your application to get a local representation of your architecture
and then get runtime metrics from every container to measure its energy use and performance metrics.

Some metrics that are not available on a container level, like CPU energy or DRAM energy are
retrieved on a system level and optionally attributed to a level of container granularity.

### UNIX style of Metric Reporters

To measure the containers we rely on the concept of *Metric Reporters*.
These are small UNIX-style programs that typically reporty only one metric directly to STDOUT.

This keeps the profile of the measurement extremely low and makes the *Metric Reporters* versatile and reuasable.

We support many different varieties of reporters like:
- Memory per Container
- CPU % per Container
- CPU Time per Container
- Energy System Wide
- Network Traffic per Container
- DC Energy of System (TBD 08/2022)
- AC Energy of System (TBD 2022)
- TDP Estimation (TBD 08/2022)

### Reusability of Infrastructure as Code

We want to reuse infrastructure files as best as possible.

Therefore our tools consumes ready-built containers and will also be able to consume Kubernetes
infrastructure files.

The format of the [usage_scenario.yml â†’]({{< relref "usage-scenario" >}}) is based of the `docker-compose.yml` specification but does provide additional options to run the container, which are very helpful in terms of reusing other peoples containers.
For instance you can run an `apt install` to install one missing tool in a standard `ubuntu` container without having the need to create a new image on DockerHub.

However we do not allow the full options of `docker compose` as this would allow to mount arbitrary volumes on our measurement machines or even run in `--priviledged` mode.

## Reproducibility & Open Data

To make people energy aware whilst using and creating software we believe that it is essential to have
every measurement open and visible.

The tools used to make these measurements must also be free and open-source (FOSS).

To however compare one measurement with another we believe that energy comparisons between
different softwares running on hardware setups is not feasible.
All measurements should be compared only for the exact same machine, not even machines with 
identical components.

Therefore we provide a central repository for all the measurements we make to compare measurements on prepared fixed machine we provide: [Green Metrics Frontend](https://metrics.green-coding.org)

## Honorable mentions, Differences and USPs

The Green Metrics Tool boroughs the concept of *Standard Usage Scenarios* from the [Blauer Engel](https://www.blauer-engel.de/en/productworld/resources-and-energy-efficient-software-products) / [KDE Team](https://eco.kde.org).
We also believe that they provide the best approach to understand how an application
would typically behave under real-world usecases.

Therefore we create every measurement by providing the architecture of the software and the flow
that the software shall execute in such a [usage_scenario.yml â†’]({{< relref "usage-scenario" >}}) file.

The difference here is that we focus on application architectures which are modular / distributed
and provide a more wholistic apporoach in also delivering and Open Data API and Web Frontend to display the metrics in charts.

### Greenframe.io
Our tool is also inspired by [Greenframe.io](https://www.greenframe.io) with the difference of the code
being fully free and open-source (FOSS), all data generated as Open Data and supporting terminal applications like
ML / AI tools and also plans to support Desktop applications.

Also the formulas for measurement are fully visible and to be falsified by anyone, which is not the case for Greenframe.io as they
use a proprietetary calculation model.

### Scaphandre and per-process measurement
Scaphandre is one of the major open source tools currently available to measure the energy consumption of software.

We however believe that for the job of pure energy measurement it is too complex in terms of the size of the tool. Having smaller reporters that only spit out one metric and can be technically used everywhere inline is the better way to go.

Also that Scaphandre does not handle the reproducible orchestration part to falsify the measurements is not the approach we believe is best to go. 

Therefore we decided to pursue a different path with our tool and not reuse Scaphandre.
