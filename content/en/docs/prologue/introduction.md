It is comprised of:

- A Python backend that handles the infrastructure orchestration
- C UNIX-style reporters that generate energy and resource consumption metrics
- A Python API to retrieve metrics
- A native javascript web frontend that visualizes the data from the API with nice charts

## Getting to know the Green Metrics Tool

We recommend that you start with the [Philosophy & Methodology â†’]({{< relref "philosophy-methodology" >}}) part to  
understand the *WHY* of the tool and some design decisions.

After that we recommend the [Measurement Process â†’]({{< relref "measurement-process" >}}) to  
get a high level overview of *WHAT* the tool does and *HOW*.

From here you can branch off in two paths:

- [Install and measure locally â†’]({{< relref "measuring-locally" >}})
- [Measuring with our hosted service â†’]({{< relref "measuring-service" >}})

However you choose to make the measurements, you are also able to [compare them]({{< relref "comparing" >}}).

### Install and measure locally

Refer to the installation instructions for your OS:

- [Installation on Linux â†’]({{< relref "installation-linux" >}})
- [Installation on macOS â†’]({{< relref "installation-macos" >}})

Then proceed with [containerizing and measuring your applications â†’]({{< relref "containerizing-applications" >}}) to  
understand how to prepare your app to be measured by the Green Metrics Tool.

Be sure to read the [usage_scenario.json â†’]({{< relref "usage-scenario" >}}) specification to  
get to know the flexibility of our tool to measure your application.

### Measure your own app with our online hosted service

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="This Quick Start is intended to give you an idea how the tool works and how a measurable application looks like" />}}

[Measuring with our hosted service â†’]({{< relref "measuring-service" >}})

The app you submit to our hosted service must conform  
to the [usage scenario specification]({{< relref "usage-scenario" >}})  and be [containerized]({{< relref "containerizing-applications" >}}).

After that you can look at our [Example Apps Repository](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/example-applications) to see some prepared apps that can be directly measured.
