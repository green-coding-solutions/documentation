## Browser cannot open Green Metrics Tool Frontend / ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

When you are getting an unexpected result when accessing localhost / \*.internal domain or a different website gets served / 404 / 403 check:

- Caching problem, please open Developer tools in your browser and check the *Disable Cache* option under *Network*
- Not having the hostname set correctly in `/etc/hosts` for development:
```
127.0.0.1 metrics.green-coding.internal api.green-coding.internal
127.0.0.1 green-coding-postgres-container

```
- Not accessing the Green Metrics Tool with the additional supplied port: `http://metrics.green-coding.internal:9142`
- It could be that you have other containers running and the port is overloaded, so that some
other service serves content on that port. Check your `docker ps -a`
- Also check `lsof -i | grep PORTNUMBER` to look if something on your host OS is serving content on that port

## ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED / DNS_PROBE_POSSIBLE
- Hostname of container correct? `docker ps` tells you the container name, which is also the hostname
- Are the containers on the same network? Check with `docker inspect CONTAINER_ID`
- Can access the container through browser when mapping the ports to the host OS? (See also debug mode for this)

## Run fails because *volumes*, *environment* or *ports* are in the `usage_scenario.yml`
- If you just copied your `docker-compose.yml` and wanted to reuse it but do not need the functionality, then consider using the `--skip-unsafe` flag.
- If you need the functionality then consider the `--allow-unsafe` flag

## Submodule issues

If you run into any conflicts just deinit and reinit the submodule in question:
```bash
git submodule deinit FOLDER -f
git submodule update --init FOLDER
git submodule init FOLDER
```


## General tips
- Always check container logs with `docker compose logs`. Sometimes streaming logs
does not work that well when orchestrating multiple containers and polling the directly gives you all logs.
- Add the `--debug` switche to your local calls to the `runner.py` to enter the stepping debug mode of the tool.
- Add `--allow-unsafe` to the call to `runner.py` and *ports* to your [usage_scenario.yml â†’]({{< relref "usage-scenario" >}}) to access containers through your browser in the host OS to check if the containers are delivering the expected output.
- Rebuild the containers with `docker compose down -v` and then `docker compose up -d`
- Re-run the `install.sh` script to get new configuration changes that you maybe have not yet applied after an update
