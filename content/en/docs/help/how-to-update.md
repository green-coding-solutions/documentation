## Regularly pull the repository / rebuild the containers

If you run the containers without overlaying your local filesystem they will not pick up changes by themselves.

- If you overlay the filesystem you will have to restart the containers to pick up all changes (gunicorn caches the python files).
- If you do not overlay your local filesystem you have to rebuild the containers

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="You can also go inside the container and check out the github repository manually and then restart the container, but we discourage this approach, as it would not pick up changes to the server configuration itself." />}}

## Re-Run the install script

After every new `git pull` you should run the `install.sh` script to get the newest binaries and configuration params for 
the Green Metrics Tool.
