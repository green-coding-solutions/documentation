## Other documentation?

- [API](https://api.green-coding.berlin)

## Where can I get the lastest features
- Look at our [dev branch](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/green-metrics-tool/tree/dev). As soon as some of our feature branches reach a "ready for developers" level we merge them into this branch.
    + We do not recommend to check out the feature branches, as they may contain a broken state / WIP

## Do you provide sample data / CSV exports
- We do provide [sample data on Github](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/sample-data). 
    + Since we use postgresql, it is in this format. We do not provide CSV.
