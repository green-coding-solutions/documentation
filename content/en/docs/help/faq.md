## Is the API documented?

- [API](https://api.green-coding.io)

## How can I uninstall?

See [Uninstall →]({{< relref "/docs/installation/uninstallation" >}})

## Where can I get the latest features

- The finalized milestones are publised as [Releases](https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/green-metrics-tool/releases). If you want something newer always tested and current fetatures are in the [main branch](https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/green-metrics-tool/tree/main). If you want even newer features you can check out WIPs on the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/green-metrics-tool/pulls)
  + We do not recommend to check out the feature branches for production work, as they may contain a broken state / WIP

## Do you provide sample data / CSV exports

- We do provide [sample data on Github](https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/green-metrics-tool/tree/main/data).
  + Since we use postgresql, it is in this format. We do not provide CSV.
