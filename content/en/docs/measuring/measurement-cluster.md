## Our Measurement Cluster

Our Measurement Cluster runs on NOP Linux and is the driver behind our [Hosted Service]({{< relref "measuring-service" >}}).

We have the following machines available for running measurements in our cluster:

- Fujitsu ESPRIMO P956 - Blue Angel compatible (Ubuntu 22.04)
- Fujitsu TX1330 M2 - Single-Tenant Server (Ubuntu 22.04)
- Quanta Leopard - 48-Thread Multi-Tenant Server - SoftAWERE compatible (Ubuntu 22.04)

Explanation soon to come :)
