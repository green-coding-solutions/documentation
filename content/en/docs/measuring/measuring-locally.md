Before starting to measure you must first install some prerequisites: [Installation →]({{< relref "installation-overview" >}})

If you came here from [interacting with applications →]({{< relref "interacting-with-applications" >}}) then you can also
directly user your `usage_scenario.yml`

We will use here for everybody that just jumped in a new sample application.

## Measuring a simple example load

We will make the most basic example our tool can handle:
- Base of **alpine** base container.
- Add the package `stress-ng` from `apk`
- Just run a 5 seconds stress run with default metrics providers

So let's start by going to the install folder of the Green Metrics Tool on your system and 
then preparing the `usage_scenario.yml`:

```bash
cd PATH_TO_GREEN_METRICS_TOOL/docker
docker compose up -d
cd /tmp
mkdir easiest-application
cd easiest-application
touch usage_scenario.yml
```

Now please copy the following code inside the `usage_scenario.yml`.

```yaml
name: Stress Container One Core 5 Seconds
author: Arne Tarara
version: 1
architecture: linux
services:
  simple-load-container:
    image: alpine
    setup-commands:
      - apk add stress-ng
 
 flow:
  - name: Stress
    container: simple-load-container
    commands:
      - type: console
        command: stress-ng -c 1 -t 5
        note: Starting Stress

```

Under *flow* you see that we are just calling `stress-ng -c 1 -t 5`, which will stress our CPU for 5 seconds on one core.
```bash
cd PATH_TO_GREEN_METRICS_TOOL/tools
python3 runner.py --uri /tmp/easiest-application --name testing-my-demo
````

You should see an example output like so:

```bash
Having usage scenario ....
....
....
Please access your report with the ID: XXXX-XXXX ...
```

Now you can view the report as the first item in your metrics dashbard at [http://metrics.green-coding.local:8000/request.html](http://metrics.green-coding.local:8000/request.html)


## Cron mode

If you have [installed a cronjob →]({{< relref "installation-overview" >}}) you can insert a new job at [http://metrics.green-coding.local:8000/request.html](http://metrics.green-coding.local:8000/request.html)

</p>

It will be automatically picked up and you will get sent an email with the link to the results.

In order for the email to work correctly you must set the configuration in your used `config.yml`.
