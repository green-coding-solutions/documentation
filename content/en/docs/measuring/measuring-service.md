In order to use our hosted service your application must already be on GitHub or another hosting service for Git, be [containerized →]({{< relref "containerizing-applications" >}}) and contain a [usage_scenario.yml →]({{< relref "usage-scenario" >}}) file.

If you do not have that, please check out the relevant links given.

## Trying out the hosted service with an example application

Our hosted service is available at [https://metrics.green-coding.io/](https://metrics.green-coding.io/)  
and you can [request a measurement of your application](https://metrics.green-coding.io/request.html).

You can supply the GitHub link to our provided [easy example application](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/simple-example-application) and wait for  
an email to arrive to view a report.

This example highlights that in order to measure an application you really need to only have a repository with a [usage_scenario.yml →]({{< relref "usage-scenario" >}}) file.

## Measuring your applications

The hosted service can be really helpful when you want to measure your application against a reference machine and see if the values you are getting are in the same order of magnitude.

The hosted service is free to use and makes your measurement data visible and reproducible for other people.
