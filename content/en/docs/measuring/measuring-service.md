## Running a measurement with a Github Repository

The easiest way to run a measurement is to use our [Hosted Service](https://metrics.green-coding.org/request.html).

Here you can supply the link of our [easiest example application](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/simple-example-application) and wait
for an email to arrive to view a report.

This example highlights, that in order to measure an application you really need to only have a repository with a
 [usage_scenario.yml →]({{< relref "usage-scenario" >}}) file.
