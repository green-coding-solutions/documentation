### What it does

This metric provider calculates an estimate of the % total CPU usage based on the cgroups stats file of your system cgroup processes. More information about cgroups can be found in the [Linux manual pages](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html).

It can be used for system monitoring and tracking background processes such as the desktop environment. It is also used to calculate GMT's overhead.

### Classname

- `CpuUtilizationCgroupSystemProvider`

### Metric Name

- `cpu_utilization_cgroup_system`

### Input Parameters

- args
  - `-s`: cgroup name strings separated by commas
  - `-i`: interval in milliseconds

By default the measurement interval is 100 ms.

```bash
./metric-provider-binary -i 100 -s org.gnome.Shell@wayland.service,session-2.scope
```

### Output

This metric provider prints to Stdout a continuous stream of data. The format of the data is as follows:

`TIMESTAMP READING CGROUP-NAME`

Where:

- `TIMESTAMP`: Unix timestamp, in microseconds
- `READING`: The estimated % CPU used
- `CGROUP-NAME`: The cgroup name that this reading is for

Any errors are printed to Stderr.

### How it works

This metric provider uses the exact same code as the metric provider ["CPU % - cgroup - container" â†’]({{< relref "cpu-utilization-cgroup-container#how-it-works" >}}).
