### What it does

This metric provider reads the DRAM energy from the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface via a machine specific registers (MSR) that is present on most modern Intel processers. In depth information about RAPL can be found [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html).

This MSR keeps a running count of the energy used in a specified domain in microJoules. This metric provider specifically reads from the `energy-pkg` domain, which gives you the energy used by all the domains.


### System Setup
On kernels > 2.6 all the kernel modules should automatically be loaded.

However just in case run:

```bash
sudo modprobe intel_rapl_common # or intel_rapl for kernels < 5
sudo modprobe intel_rapl_msr
sudo modprobe rapl
```


### Technical specs

- Time resolution: 976 micro-seconds
- Energy resolution: 15.3 micro-Joules

### Classname

- `MemoryEnergyRaplMsrComponentProvider`

### MetricName

- `memory_energy_rapl_msr_component`

### Input Parameters

- Args:
    - i: specifies interval in milliseconds between measurements
    - d: Must be set to activate the DRAM reading mode.

```bash
./metric-provider-binary -i 100 -d
```

### Output

This metric provider prints to Stdout a continuous stream of data. The format of the data is as follows:

`TIMESTAMP ENERGY_OUTPUT`

Where:
- `TIMESTAMP`: Unix timestamp, in microseconds
- `ENERGY_OUTPUT`: Energy used during interval, in micro Joules
- `DRAM_ID`: ID of the DRAM controller measured in case you have multiple memory controllers installed. Otherwise always. Otherwise *DRAM_0*

Example output:

```txt
1712641603443421 2092 DRAM_0
1712641604443831 2047 DRAM_0
```

Any errors are printed to Stderr.

### How it works

We use a modified version of the open source code found here: ([github](https://github.com/deater/uarch-configure/blob/master/rapl-read/rapl-read.c))

First we check if the DRAM is compatible by reading the cpu info from `/proc/cpuinfo` and checking against the following list of supported CPUs:

```txt
CPU_SANDYBRIDGE, CPU_SANDYBRIDGE_EP, CPU_IVYBRIDGE, CPU_IVYBRIDGE_EP, CPU_HASWELL, CPU_HASWELL_ULT, CPU_HASWELL_GT3E, CPU_HASWELL_EP, CPU_BROADWELL, CPU_BROADWELL_GT3E, CPU_BROADWELL_EP, CPU_BROADWELL_DE, CPU_SKYLAKE, CPU_SKYLAKE_HS, CPU_SKYLAKE_X, CPU_KNIGHTS_LANDING, CPU_KNIGHTS_MILL, CPU_KABYLAKE_MOBILE, CPU_KABYLAKE, CPU_ATOM_SILVERMONT, CPU_ATOM_AIRMONT, CPU_ATOM_MERRIFIELD, CPU_ATOM_MOOREFIELD, CPU_ATOM_GOLDMONT, CPU_ATOM_GEMINI_LAKE, CPU_TIGER_LAKE
```
It reads the values from `/dev/cpu/%d/msr`

Note that since it reads the energy used by the entire system, any other load that your system has during a program's usage run will also be captured in the energy measurement.
