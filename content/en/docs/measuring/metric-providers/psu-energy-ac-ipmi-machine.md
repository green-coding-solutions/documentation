### What it does

This metric provider uses the [IPMI protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface) to get sensor data from the current power
draw of the system.
This can either come from a sensor that is accessible via `ACPI` or via other means through the `libsensors`.

### Technical specs

Most IPMI sensors do not supply data more often than once per second. Polling them more often is advised to catch
the transition of the value, but if the value is averaged internally over 1 second or if it just a single measurement
depends on the BMC / ILO / iDRAC that IPMI is querying.

### Install

You will need  `sudo apt-get install freeipmi-tools ipmitool` installed on a Debian based distro.
This installation step will automatically happen if you normally install the tool with the `./install_linux.sh` script.

The install script will also set a `sudoers.d` entry so that the underlying
program `/usr/sbin/ipmi-dcmi --get-system-power-statistics` can execute without password request.

On some systems you will need to run the detect program first `sudo sensors-detect` which looks at all the chips
in your computer and creates the config file.

### Classname

- `PsuEnergyAcIpmiMachineProvider`

### Metric Name

- `psu_energy_ac_ipmi_machine`


### Input Parameters

- `-i`: interval in milliseconds. By default the measurement interval is 100 ms.


```bash
> ./ipmi-get-machine-energy-stat.sh -i 100
```

### Output

This metric provider prints to stdout a continuous stream of data every `interval` milliseconds till it is stopped with
`sigkill` or `sigint` (Ctrl-c). The format of the data is as follows:

`TIMESTAMP READING`

Where:
- `TIMESTAMP`: Unix timestamp, in microseconds
- `READING`: The value taken from sensors in milliWatts with two significant digits (Ex. 14000 for 14 Watts)

Any errors are printed to stderr.
