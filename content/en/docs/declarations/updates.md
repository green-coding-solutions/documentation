## Updates

Green Metrics Tool aims to have a 30-60 day release cycle for every new version.

New versions will be announced in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/green-metrics-tool/releases)

## Security Updates

Green Metrics Tool uses GitHub Actions to automatically pull in security updates from dependecies.

Furthermore security vulnerabilities own to the Green Metrics Tool itself will be patched as soon as the vendor
is aware of them.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability please contact info@green-coding.io for disclosure.

Non critical vulnerabilites can also be disclosed via GitHub Issues.

The software is open source and thus security updates can also be integrated any time via pull requests.

As a vendor we thrive to provide security updates to the software indefinitely, even if further feature
development will stop.

Security updates will always be free of charge even if a paid hosted version of the product is used.
