Green Metrics Tool is a highly modular product.

All components like the [metric_providers →]({{< relref "/docs/measuring/metric-providers/metric-providers-overview" >}}), the 
[frontend →]({{< relref "/docs/frontend" >}}) and also the *Python scripts* can be used independently.

The [frontend →]({{< relref "/docs/frontend" >}}) can be fully customized to your own company or community needs. See [customization →]({{< relref "/docs/frontend/customization" >}}).

Furthermore all [metric_providers →]({{< relref "/docs/measuring/metric-providers/metric-providers-overview" >}}) can 
be activated or deactivated for any run at any time. Please see [Configuration →]({{< relref "/docs/measuring/metric-providers/metric-providers-overview" >}})
