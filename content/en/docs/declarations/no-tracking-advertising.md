## Advertising

Green Metrics Tool will never have advertising for 3rd parties.

In some places our names and logos can appear. If you host the software your own you may however remove any names
and banners as long as you are not in breach with the [Open Source license of the software](https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/green-metrics-tool/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Tracking and data privacy

Green Metrics Tool does not have any tracking at the moment.

If any tracking will be integrated at any point it will be only on active user consent and never un-solicited.

In case you are using our hosted service an implicit tracking is happening because you send a network packet with
your IP address.
This data is only used and stored if needed for the energy and carbon calculations.

Furthermore if you use an email to use our hosted service to get notified your e-mail will only be stored for the
purpose of sending the notification mail kept at a maximum of 14 days for error handling purposes.
