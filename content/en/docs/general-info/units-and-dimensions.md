# Measurement

This paragraph looks at the units and dimensions when using the measurement functionality of GMT.

## Units and dimensions

- Energy - micro-Joules [uJ] (64-bit int)
- Power - milli-Watts [mW] (64-bit int)
- Data / Memory Usage - Bytes (64-bit int)
- I/O - Bytes/s  (64-bit int)
- Carbon - micro-Grams [ug]  (64-bit int)
- Temperature - centi째C  (64-bit int)
- Utilization - Ratio   (64-bit int)
- SCI - ugCO2e/R  (64-bit int)
- Frequency - Hz  (64-bit int)
- Time - micro-Seconds [us]  (64-bit int)


### Bytes / Bytes/s are SI-Units

It is very important to note that GMT uses SI-Units for Bytes.

This means that 1 kB means 1.000 Bytes and not 1.024 Bytes as it would in non-SI-Units or binary display schemes.

This notation is in line with newest international number standards.

See the [Wikipedia Page](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) for details.

## Lowest possible resolution / precision

Since all values are stored as 64-bit integer values the smallest resolution the GMT can understand is dicretly derived from the dimension that we store.

Example: No energy value below 1 micro-Joules can be understood and will be rounded off as we store all energy in micro-joules precision

For temperature it is similar. Since we store in centi째C the smallest resolution is 0.01 째C, which we store as 1 cent째C.

Identical for Utilization where 0.01 is the smallest value.

# CarbonDB

CarbonDB stores all values as 64-bit floating point values. Respectively:

- Carbon - micro-Grams (64-bit double precision)
- Energy - micro-Joules (64-bit double precision)

Thus the lowest resolution is directly derived from the storage scheme and to keep it brief: It is absurdly large, as well as absurdly small :)
