## Python venv include paths

GMT uses the Python `.pth` magic file mechanism to force an always enabled include path.

The file will be created when you run the *install* script and will be located under `./venv/lib/python3.XX/site-packages/gmt-lib.pth`

This mechanism was chosen as it provides the least friction and allows to run the CLI functions of the GMT with a normall `python3 xxx.py` .

Alternatively in the future we might consider running GMT as a module command (`python3 -m`) or as a system wide available executable.
